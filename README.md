# Content-Based-Recommendation-System

Created a user profile based on the movies the user has watched and a movie profile based on its genre.

Utilized the lsa package in R to calculate the cosine similarity metrics between the user and each of the movies.

Developed a Movie Recommendation Engine from the user profiles and the movie profiles and suggested the possible movies for the user to watch.
